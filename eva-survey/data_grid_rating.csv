2025/05/19 11:41:57 am GMT-4,Architect,5,Excessive grid density;Missing key reference anchors,3,2,3,"I believe it is very useful in all cases to see suggested grid lines, as it saves time. For Manhattan-type projects, the grids mostly fit well since the model is not complicated. Designers can check and easily update them with minor changes if necessary. However, in more complex projects, trying to understand the grids might also take time and cause confusion. Still, I believe it generally saves time compared to creating them from scratch.","When the tool creates them, it would be helpful to easily adjust their positions directly from the suggested version, as well as remove some of them or add new ones if needed."

The time taken by the original desginer and the time taken by a user and the time taken by a designer wo takes up the renewal or renovation will be different and therefore the less the complexity the less time it takes to work with the model.","the idea is good generally but i would reccomend to reduce the complexity of grids and use minimal functions considering that its automatically generated , more lines can be added if needed but deleting excessive grids is in my opinion not neeeded."

However, I would say that grid determination is relative to the designer's experience, so the same design might have 200 grids or 202 grids, and both are right. What is most important is that the grids cover the requirements, such as assigning column locations to the grid, so the distance between columns and the grid should not extend more than a specific value, so it would be easier later to handle the model.","I would recommend using AI to gather the data from already done projects to get a suitable pattern of aligning the grids with elements, not a specific algorithm to code."
